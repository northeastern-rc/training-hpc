* Exercise_2 - MPI with Python example (mpi4py)
* Exercise_3 - Slurm job array example
* Exercise_4 - Speedup, efficiency and weak scaling examples. 
* Exercise_5 - Example of using InfiniBand-supported MPI.

## Steps to download and use the repo on NU's high performance computing cluster:
1. Login to the HPC system shell or use the [OnDemand interface](https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/connect_ood.html).

2. Enter your desired directory and download the training material. For example:
```bash
cd $HOME
git clone git@github.com:northeastern-rc/training-hpc.git
cd training-hpc
```
3. Download the training slides to your local computer from the [RC Canvas course](https://northeastern.instructure.com/enroll/LNNCHN), where you have access to PowerPoint to open the slides. Follow the slides to execute different examples.
